# preprocessor
This C program reads an input file, processes specific lines based on predefined keywords, and generates corresponding C code in an output file. It primarily focuses on handling operations related to array declarations, initialization, copying, reading from files, and printing array elements. The program is designed to work with multi-dimensional arrays and outputs the appropriate C code for each operation.
